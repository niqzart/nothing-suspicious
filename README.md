# Nothing Suspicious
## Description
Website and API for creating, viewing and managing not-at-all suspicious links. You can give these links to anyone and see how many times people got caught. You can [try it out](https://autopilottonowhere.com/)! Or [create your own links](TBA).

Just for practice I added user system to this, including a mailing server to send confirmation emails. You can even exclude your own clicks on the link from the link count!

## Technologies in use:
- Flask
  - Flask-CORS
  - Flask-JWT-Extended
  - Flask-RESTX
- SQLAlchemy
  - ...
- More to come...

## Links:
- [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)
- [website on heroku](TBA)
